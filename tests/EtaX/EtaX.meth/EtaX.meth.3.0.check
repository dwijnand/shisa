   |                       method meth must be called with () argument

Explanation
===========
Previously an empty argument list () was implicitly inserted when calling a nullary method without arguments. E.g.

def next(): T = ...
          |next     // is expanded to next()

In Dotty, this idiom is an error. The application syntax has to follow exactly the parameter syntax.
Excluded from this rule are methods that are defined in Java or that override methods defined in Java.

   |Only function types can be followed by _ but the current expression has type String

Explanation
===========
The syntax x _ is no longer supported if x is not a function.
To convert to a function value, you need to explicitly write () => x
